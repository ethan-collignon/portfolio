Play/layout for portfolio

Navbar and landing page to start. Landing page of a central image with my name and introduction over it. Nav bar at the top with scrollspy to the different sections of the page. 
(nav sections would be (home, about me, skills, portolio, get in contact))

below that an about me section. Burb about myself

below that a skills sections. I liked the responsive buttons on carolyn harris's example.

below that my portfolio. I again like carolyn's. She has thumnails of the projects organized nicely. each is a clickable link to the project code

below that a form that is required.

Then below that in the footer. Have icon links to my github, linkedin and a download resume button. 


google fonts can help pick different fonts
